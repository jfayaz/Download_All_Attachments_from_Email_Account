## Download all attachments from your Email account

This code will create a folder 'attachments' and download all the attachments of 
all of your emails associated with the given mail box such as 'INBOX', in the

Once you run the code you will prompted to enter your email id and your password

After entering the email id and password, all the mailboxes present in your email

from which you want to download the attachments. Please type the name of the mailbox
correctly and soon all your attachments will start downloading in the attachments 
folder.

NOTE: Please make sure to turn off the two-step verification of your email to 
make this code work. Also currently the code is designed to work only for gmail
associated emails but can be changed to include others by changing the imap
